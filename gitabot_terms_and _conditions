    <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2> <p>By using the bot, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the bot. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
                    app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
                    source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
                    derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                    property rights related to it, still belong to prinia apps.</p> <p>prinia apps is committed to ensuring that the bot is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the bot. We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                        you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the bot.</p> <p>At some point, we may wish to update the bot. The bot is currently available on kik app on Android &amp; iOS – the
                        requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems or apps we decide to extend the availability
                        of the bot to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                        bot. Prinia apps does not promise that it will always update the bot so that it is relevant
                        to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
                        you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
                        stop providing the bot and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                        to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
                        you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the bot, and (if needed) delete it from your
                        device.
